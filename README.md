# Writeups

I don't write writeups of everything I solved, only those at which I found interesting, which is heavily biased towards Crypto.

## RARCTF 2021

Awww wished i spent more time on this CTF. Eitherways had a really fun run with CTF.SG

| Name | Category | Remarks |
| ---- | -------- | ------- |
| [A3S](./RARCTF-2021/A3S) | Crypto | Really fun challenge. Took me a while to realise that the whole cipher is linear. Maybe I should have read up on AES before this |
| [randompad](./RARCTF-2021/randompad) | Crypto | MT19937 challenge + RSA coppersmith. Finicky to set up but fun and challenging |
| [Mini-A3S](./RARCTF-2021/Mini-A3S) | Crypto | Wow this was hard. Probably the hardest challenge I've completed so far |
| PsychECC | Crypto | Heh |
| rotoRSA | Crypto | Ooo cool take on polynomial gcd |
